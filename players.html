                            <img src ="img/waynerooneygif.gif" style="width: 100%;height: 100%;">

                            <p>Scholes came through the Manchester United youth academy as one of Fergie's Fledglings (a group of players recruited by Manchester United under the management of Sir Alex Ferguson). Scholes made his full debut for Manchester United in the 1994–95 season. He went on to make 718 appearances for United, the third-highest number of appearances by any player for the club.</p> 
                            <p>Scholes announced his retirement from playing in May 2011 and was appointed as a coach at Manchester United. However, he returned to playing in January 2012, and went on to play one more season for the club before retiring again in May 2013. With United, Scholes won 25 trophies including 11 Premier League titles (more than any other English player) and two UEFA Champions League titles.</p>

                            <h2 id="C3">Eric Cantona</h2>

                            <img src = "img/cantona.gif"  style = "width: 100%;height: 100%;">
                            <p>Cantona is often regarded as having played a key role in the revival of Manchester United as a footballing force in the 1990s and having an iconic status at the club.[5] He wore the No. 7 shirt at Manchester United, and is known for turning up his collar.[6] Cantona is affectionately nicknamed by Manchester United fans as "King Eric" and was voted as the team's greatest ever player by Inside United magazine.</p>

                            <h2 id="C4">Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
                            <p>Ronaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04 season. His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.</p>            
                            <img src = "img/cristiano.gif"  style = "width: 100%;height: 100%;">
                            <p>Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his manager, Alex Ferguson, of whom he later said, "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."</p>
                            <p>Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007–08 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England.</p>

                            <img src = "img/giggs.gif"  style = "width: 100%;height: 100%;">
                            <p>Giggs is one of the most decorated footballers of all time.
